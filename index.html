                    I was an Intern at Microsoft Corporation under the Enterprise and Security Team. During my internship, I built a pipeline that uses a querying interface to extract >1TiB IoT Hub Device data from Azure Cloud. I also performed statistical analysis on >60% of IoT Hub Devices and visually represented the results using PowerBi. In addition, I successfully completed a hands-on Cloud Development Boot Camp focused on implementing reliable applications for the cloud.

                    This project involved the implementation of three Local Search Algorithms: 
                    Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Stochastic Beam Search. 
                    These algorithms were used to solve the NP-Complete Problem of Graph Coloring in Computer Science. 
                    The goal of this problem is to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share 
                    the same color while minimizing the number of colors used. 
                    I conducted several experiments on these algorithms to compare their performance 
                    in solving any Graph Coloring Problem by varying different parameters.

                    A project involving the implementation of two adversarial search algorithms:
                    Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) and Minimax Algorithms. These algorithms were used to play the Connect-4 Game on the terminal. 
                    I implemented a Connect-4 game version that uses the terminal. I ran several experiments on these algorithms to compare 
                    their performance using different parameters. Specifically, I varied the number of rollouts for MCTS and the search depth for Minimax.                  </div>
